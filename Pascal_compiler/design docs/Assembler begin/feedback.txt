Lincoln,

Below is one of my test programs.  

When I stepped through your assembler code I noticed that your used registers get off.  After the division you start using ECX and EDX instread of EAX and EBX.  Your missing freeing a register in some location.

The procedure Doit with no parameters does not create the correct assembler code.  Missing both the header and the footer.  This crashes when stepping through the assembler code.

var x,y,sum:integer; 

var A:integer;     

 

procedure doit();

begin

  

end;

 

procedure SumAvg(P1,P2:integer; var Avg,loc:integer);

 

var s,t:integer;   

begin

    s:=P1+P2;

    sum:=s;

    Avg:=sum/2;

    Avg:=Avg+1;

end;

 

begin

    x:=5;

    y:=7;

    SumAvg(5,y,A,sum);

    doit();

end.


If I put the following instructions below into the procedure SumAvg it crashes your compiler.  Each of these should compile and I'm testing what kind of assembler is produced.

    p1:=65;

    p2:=66;

    loc:=99;

    t:=97;

When I tested your compiler with the code given on the assignment your paramters went on in the wrong order.  The first parameter should alway go on last that way [edi+8] will retrieve it.

original code:

var x,y,sum:integer;  

var A:integer;      

 

procedure SumAvg(var Avg:integer; P2, P1:integer);

 

 

var s:integer;    

 

begin

    s:=P1+P2;

    sum:=s;

    Avg:=sum/2;

    Avg:=Avg+1;

end;

begin

    x:=5;

    y:=7;

    SumAvg(A,y,x);

end.


Lincoln I will give you some points back if you fix.
